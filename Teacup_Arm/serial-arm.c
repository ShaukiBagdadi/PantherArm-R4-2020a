  \brief Serial subsystem, ARM specific part.

  To be included from serial.c, for more details see there.

  Other than AVRs, ARMs feature a serial buffer in hardware, so we can get
  away without a software buffer and also without(!) interrupts.

  Code here is heavily inspired by serial_api.c of MBED, found in
  mbed/libraries/mbed/targets/hal/TARGET_NXP/TARGET_LPC11XX_11CXX/.

    Calculating the neccessary values for a proper baud rate is pretty complex
    and, as system clock and baudrate are known at compile time and never
    changed at runtime, unneccessary.

    However, how to get these values? Well, we do kind of an easter-egg. If
    parameters are not known, we calculate them at runtime anyways, and also
    report them to the user. So she can insert them here and after doing so,
    whoops, serial fast and binary small :-)

    Replacing this calculation with fixed values makes the binary a whopping
    564 bytes smaller.
